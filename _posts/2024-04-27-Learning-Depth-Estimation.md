title: Learning - Depth Estimation
---

As part of my goal to learn a bunch of new things, I am starting with `depth estimation`. I will either do 1/5/10 hours of learning, depending on how it goes! This post will keep updating.

### What is depth estimation?



### Why is depth estimation useful?



### High Quality Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11941v2


### Depth estimation from images vs. video


### Alternative methods

What else can we use? What other type of sensors are there to estimate depth and how does their efficacy compare to using images/video?

Is there a standard benchmark that people use?

What is state of the art for: self driving cars, robotics, etc.


### Real-time depth estimation

How does this work? What sensors are needed?
