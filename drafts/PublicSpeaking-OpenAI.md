
In this post I show how to analyze your speaking words per minute using the OpenAI Audio Transcription API. 

# Background

We recently had a meeting at work where people were sharing their team's accomplishments from the previous quarter and what thye would be doing in the upcoming quarter.

As I usually do, I prepared some slides with images and content before to try and make things entertaining and also informative. I also prepped a few times by walking through what I would say, without scripting too much.

The meeting went well and I thought I did a solid job sharing what our team had done. I felt really comfortable sharing the content and felt like I went at a good pace. I let my wife know, she smiled, and I didn't think much of it.

After these meetings someone usually shares a recording for people who couldn't make it. When my manager did that, I figured I would give it a quick watch to see how my part went.

To my surprise, I was talking much much much faster than I thought I was :)

Right away I went to tell my wife and she smiled. My office is upstairs but not closed in. She had heard me talking and knew it was too fast but didn't want to say anything.

So clearly there was a significant gap between how others were seeing me present and my self perception.

# Looking for a solution

My first response in situations like this is to figure out how to improve. So I immediately started looking for books and public speaking coaches, of which there are quite a few!

Unfortunately, a lot of the public speaking coaches did not appear to be available or were more expensive than what I wanted to spend.

What I really want is to understand what makes for good public speaking and then get an objective assessment of how I am doing, so that I can improve.

I started seeing posts about the ideal speaking words per minute (140-160) and other things like the use of filler words, pauses, and intonation. All things I had heard of before but had never assessed myself against.

# Objective analysis

While there are many attributes to great public speaking, I wanted to start with something simple (and my glaring issue) - speaking pace.

In order to do this, I figured I just needed something that could take audio as an input and let me know which words were spoken and when, then it's easy to calculate speaking rate.

Thankfully OpenAI has a great APi to do this - their Audio Transcription API.






# What's next?

Now that I've got this working, I plan to add more features like checking for filler words, intonation, pauses, and more. Another interesting one will be to assess the "grade level" of the speach - similar to what you 
might do for an article you write, to see if it's simple enough.
